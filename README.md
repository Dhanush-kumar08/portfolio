DESCRIPTION:
üìù Task 3: Portfolio Website ‚Äì CodTech Internship
As part of the Front-End Development Internship at CodTech, Task 3 required me to design and develop a personal portfolio website using only HTML and CSS. This task was aimed at helping interns understand the core concepts of responsive web design and the importance of personal branding for developers. The goal was to build a fully responsive single-page website that effectively showcases a developer‚Äôs profile, skills, and projects.

The portfolio website serves as a digital resume for developers and plays a crucial role in personal branding, professional visibility, and career advancement. This task challenged me to plan, structure, and style a webpage without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks, thereby reinforcing my knowledge of pure front-end fundamentals.

The webpage includes several core sections:

Header and Navigation: The site begins with a fixed header that includes navigation links to the major sections of the portfolio: Home, About, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The navigation is simple, clean, and allows for smooth movement within the page.

Hero Section: This is the introductory section where I included my name, role, and a short tagline. It acts as the first impression for visitors.

About Section: This portion provides a short bio, background information, and career objectives. It's designed to give visitors a quick overview of who I am.

Projects Section: One of the most critical components, this section showcases two to three sample projects. Each project listing includes the project name, a brief description, and a link to the GitHub repository or live demo. This demonstrates my hands-on experience with front-end technologies.

Skills Section: This is a list of my technical skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and tools like Git and VS Code. It's a concise way to show my expertise and learning focus.

Contact Section: Here, I provided my professional email and optionally a contact form (if HTML form handling was desired). This section invites collaboration or connection from potential recruiters or clients.

The styling was handled entirely through CSS. I made the design responsive using media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid, ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktops. Careful attention was paid to typography, spacing, and visual hierarchy to ensure a clean and professional look.

This task taught me how to structure a single-page application using semantic HTML, maintain consistent styling, and ensure responsive behavior across different devices. It also helped me understand the importance of accessibility and user-friendly design in a real-world project.

After development, I version-controlled the project using Git and hosted the code on GitHub, following the internship requirement of maintaining a GitHub repository for each task. I also ensured that my code was well-commented and clean for readability.

Overall, Task 3 was an excellent opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills, apply creative design principles, and build a meaningful project that I can include in my resume and share with potential employers or collaborators.
